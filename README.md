# Powerpuff Girls DOOM Mod

This mod features everybody's favorite superhero trio who are the sole heroes for protecting the City of Townsville. Now, they have arrived in the world of DOOM and it's time to kick some demonic butt.

This mod requires GZDoom and a copy of either DOOM or DOOM II (recommended). The former you can grab for free on the ZDoom website (https://zdoom.org/downloads) and the latter you can purchase either or both digital copies on either Steam or GOG.

This mod is currently in its beta stage.

Feel free to report any bugs in the issues tab and leave any suggestions with regards to what features you want in the mod.

# How to Play

There are some extra options with regards to this mod if you look under "PPG Options" in the main "Options" menu. So, do pay close attention in order to use this mod to its full potential.

- Gun Mode: Here, you can toggle the presence of usable guns. This is turned off by default.
- Superpowers: There are buttons for toggling superpowers and using them. They are as follows:
  - Next and previous superpowers (Z and X by default respectively)
  - Use superpower (I use the right mouse button)
